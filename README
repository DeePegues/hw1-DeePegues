hi
Prof. Hoyle let me turn this in late :)

EC) There are 263146 cases
wc -l COVIDSummaryData.csv

1) Lorain has 5031 cases
 grep -o -i Lorain COVIDSummaryData.csv | wc -l

2) There are 131901 female cases, there are 256442 male cases
 grep -o -i Male/Female COVIDSummaryData.csv | wc -l

3) Could get this to work but here is what I came up with
cut -d "," -f 1 COVIDSummaryData.csv | grep -ro COVIDSummaryData.csv | wc -l

4)
cut -d "," -f3 COVIDSummaryData.csv |

I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment
